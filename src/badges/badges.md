# {{ title }}

Welcome to the badge reference! This place contains the pages to all the badge types, shows how to use the badges, and some recommendations when putting badges in your page.

Also, you don't need to add credit - it would be nice for you to do so, but I really don't care if you do or not. I just make these for fun!

## üëç Recommendations

While you don't have to do these, I recommend following these guidelines to make sure the badges look great on your page.

- Use HTML versions when possible
- Use SVG (`*_vector.svg`) versions when possible, unless you are using Markdown
- Keep badge sizes in the recommended heights (available on each type page, and here)
- Don't modify the badges unless needed
- Don't have the badges too close to other text
