# 🏅 About

This is Devin's Badges! A project I work on in my spare time that contains cool badges for you to use in your projects.

I aim to be as consistent as possible with these. I also try to make these look great on most modern sites.

## 📰 Using in your project

Want to add these badges to your page? Head over to the [badge reference](./badges) to find the badges most fitting for your use, and how to use them. You can then copy the HTML code, which I recommend for best customizability, or the Markdown code for your chosen badge, and paste that into your file.

## ➕ Adding more badges

Want to add your own badge ideas to the project? Feel free to open up an issue and I'll make one!

You can make badges for your own personal use aswell if I am not available; it's pretty easy to make the badges as long as you know a bit of Figma.

## ⭐ Enjoy this project?

Please star the GitHub repository if you enjoy this project!

## ❗ Disclaimer

This is currently a work in progress, I only have a few badges for a few services right now. However, I am planning to have a lot more badges in the coming weeks.
