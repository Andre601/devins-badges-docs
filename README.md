# Devin's Badges Docs

Welcome! This is where the documentation is located for Devin's Badges.

## Building and Contributing

This site is made with [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy).

To start, make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) & [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed, then run:

```zsh
npm install # Install dependencies
npm run serve # Start dev server
```

After that, you are free to modify files. Every time you edit, it will immediately show up on the dev server. You then make a pull request as normal, and once merged it will be available on the live website.
